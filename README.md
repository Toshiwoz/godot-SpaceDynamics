I am creating a series of tools to help create star systems and other space dynamic objects within Godot Engine

For orbits representation I'll be using AU (149.597.870.700 meters) as measurement unit

Todos:

- [x] implement a GUI to list all the orbiting objects (included type)
- [ ] implement orbits algorythm
- [ ] plot orbit path
- [x] implement orbital camera
- [ ] implement ship physics
- [ ] implement chase camera (possibly other camera views)
